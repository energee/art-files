// collab-variant-goldens.test.ts — the byte-identity gate for the shipped
// Lolev label in the only two states the product ships, Collab OFF and ON,
// each pinning all three deliverables: the art PDF, the mask PDF and the
// PSD. PDF timestamps are pinned (PDF_EPOCH in src/pdf/build.ts), so
// identical input builds byte-identical output and a sha256 IS byte
// identity.
//
// All hashes re-baselined 2026-09-27 (#359 review): the barcode backing
// fills the layer's 8X quiet zone instead of GS1's 9X. Zero changed pixels
// at 600 DPI on these fixtures; over a dark flood, 5,844 px at the backing's
// two ends only (see goldens/README.md).
//
// All hashes re-baselined 2026-09-27 (#284): barcode backing added.
// The bare-stock/flood PDF fixtures have zero changed pixels at 600 DPI.
// PSD backing geometry is tested; Photoshop visual review remains pending.
//
// Art PDFs re-baselined 2026-09-27 (#339): neutral vectors use DeviceGray.
// Both 600-DPI RGB raster diffs have zero changed pixels; mask/PSD unchanged.
//
// RE-BASELINED 2026-09-04 for the master-as-layers switch (spec: Goldens):
// the backends now draw a display list planned by planLayers over
// model/lolevLayers' data instead of a LabelConfig through layout.ts. The
// 600 DPI raster diffs against the previous goldens are committed beside
// this file as tests/goldens/collab-{off,on}-{art,mask}.diff.png; the only
// changed pixels (99275 art / 53661 mask, identical OFF and ON) are the
// warning's LAST column, which the old renderer justified to the full
// column length and the generic text path leaves at its natural length
// (spec: "justify on a last/only line degrades to left"). Nothing else
// moved — the collab block included.
//
// PSD digests RE-BASELINED 2026-09-26 for #338: every PSD now declares its
// export DPI — a ResolutionInfo (0x03ED) resource and an XMP packet with the
// tiff: resolution tags. Each file grew by exactly those two resources (28 +
// 350 bytes); no layer, pixel or PDF byte moved (the PDF digests are
// unchanged), and tests/psd-build.test.ts pins the declared print size.
//
//   OFF — the collab variant off: its three layers are not in the resolved
//         list at all, so BOTH slot assets being loaded (the hard case: art
//         in hand that must not draw) changes nothing.
//   ON  — the variant on, both slots bound to a 1x1 PNG and drawing.
//
// Only HALF this guard is load-bearing for collab: the four PDF digests
// really do differ between the two states. The PSD digests pin the PSD
// against unrelated drift (PSD raster review remains pending; see goldens/README.md) and prove the empty-slot rule (the PSD build here
// gets no pixels for the slots, so ON adds only the lead-in group); the
// real collab-art PSD guard is tests/psd-collab.test.ts.
//
// A digest that moves is NOT a golden to regenerate outside an approved
// rendering change: it is proof that what prints changed. Stop and report
// it, or re-baseline per docs/goldens.md with a reviewed diff PNG.
